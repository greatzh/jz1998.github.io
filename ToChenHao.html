<br />
i always don't know how to deal with those things well such as interaction with others.<br>
<br />
Also CHENHAO, yeah i wrote your name, it's kind of weird, i am a boy, how can i want to know a male.<br>
<br />
So you may also weird how can i know your name, ennnn…… unintentional or purpose? it's all like the coincidence fate. i remember that seems one time i waiting the queue of buying rice in south canteen after you, so i saw your name displayed on the card machine. OK, i haven't refered your id card or books.<br>
<br />
Of course, i clearly know it'sn't that love which know as an attraction to a person of the opposite sex. A friend of mine who study psychology in her bachelor period told me that i am lack of such kind of friends in my daily life in fact,  not i really love u, also, there is definitely some attractions in yours can stay at my eyes.  <br>
 <br />             
Fine, i don't know what special characteristics about u attract me. Wearing style such as the pink T, sunglasses, life attitude like everyday going back to dormitory to take a noon nap…? i really don't know, i can summary it with a thing called magic? <br>
<br />
Have to say, there are lots of people in my life like this that i really want to konw and hope that we can acknowledge each other with the word "friends", however boys or girls.<br>
<br />
So above the content about my feelings expressing, some words i still wanna to say is that i should apologize to u for that i always watching u sometimes in that summer, which my mom has told me never staring to sb unfamiliar long long ago. So if staring u ever bother u, please accept my apology. i also hope that this uninformed letter wouldn't influence your prepartions. <br>
<br />
Forget it.<br>
